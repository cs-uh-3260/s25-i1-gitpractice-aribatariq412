**One aspect of the article that I found particularly interesting was the emphasis on encryption as a continuous process rather than a one-time fix. The analogy comparing encryption to locking valuables in a safe really stood out to me.The article highlights how encryption isnâ€™t just about securing data but that it is also about controlling access points that could be exploited over time. I also found it interesting that breaking encryption algorithms is nearly impossible and how most breaches happen due to stolen keys rather than actual decryption attacks. Small implementation errors can leave important data vulnerable to attack and thus the recommendation to use proven encryption methods like AES and RSA rather than attempting to create custom encryption solutions makes a lot of sense. It made me realize just how much of modern cybersecurity is more strongly about proper key management rather than just secure encryption alone.**
